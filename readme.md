### A 7DRL hommage to Liberal Crime Squad

&#x200B;

[LCS](http://lcs.wikidot.com/) being one of my favorite game, I always wanted to make a game similar to it. So I'll try just that for this 7DRL.

&#x200B;

For anybody not knowing LCS, here is the pitch :

>Welcome to Liberal Crime Squad! The Conservatives have taken the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of government. Over time, the Liberal laws of this nation will erode and turn the country into a BACKWOODS YET CORPORATE NIGHTMARE. To prevent this from happening, the Liberal Crime Squad was established. The mood of the country is shifting, and we need to turn things around. Go out on the streets and indoctrinate Conservative automatons. That is, let them see their True Liberal Nature. Then arm them and send them forth to Stop Evil. Eventually the public will fall behind us, and we will put more Elite Liberals in government for greater justice.

&#x200B;

So, this 7DRL game will differ quite a bit from the roguelike standards, but it won't be a straight clone of LCS, which would be a bad idea in seven days.

**Main features :**

* the goal is to shift the public opinion toward liberalism, with maximum efficiency and under a certain amount of time (until the next election, something like that)
* you should be able to progress either with a pacifist or a criminal approach
* team-based game. You have a main protagonist, but you will recruit people to fight the Conservative system
* your team is expendable. If they die, it's not the end of the run, but don't let them die too much...
* there will be 2 main views : the strategic and tactical views. Basically, during the strategical view, you will explore a dungeon, turn-based, and during the tactical view the fights will happened. Something that was not in LCS and I always wanted to see...
* a dungeon is a place where you will spread liberalism. You can end it by finding the exit, and if your actions are too Liberal, there will be a Conservatism response (Death squad officer, Police, army, something like that)
* There will be a time gap between each dungeon and you can choose the next place you go to between each dungeon (kind of like FTL in a way). One place will be more action-based than the other.

&#x200B;

**Optional features :**

* A boss fight would be nice, with the CEO or the CCS squad
* The tactical view might be optional if I realise I'm too much behind.

&#x200B;

**What I won't focus too much time on :**

* AI. Bare minimum here : enemy either shoot or run toward the team.
* Dungeon generation. I'll use an existing tool for that.
* Items. There will be a few items (weapons, armor), but probably not more than ten
* Attributes and abilities : no abilities and just the barebone minimum for attributes. But Juice, obviously.

&#x200B;

I'll use libtcod for the tool.

The project is pretty ambitious for me and I probably won't finish in time, but I'll try it anyway, haha ;)
